# Smart_Log_Analyzer_for_Distributed_System

## Project Overview

**Smart Log Analyzer for Distributed System** is a web-based application designed to facilitate the analysis of log files generated by distributed systems. Leveraging advanced data processing and visualization techniques, this tool enables users to upload log files, perform statistical and anomaly analysis, and visualize log patterns interactively. The application is built using Python's Flask framework and integrates popular data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy for comprehensive log analysis.

## Key Features
- **Web Interface for Log Upload:** Simple and intuitive UI for uploading log files.
- **Automated Log Parsing:** Extracts timestamps, log levels, thread IDs, organizations, and messages from raw logs.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Provides descriptive statistics, log level distributions, and message length analysis.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies unusual log patterns using z-score based anomaly detection.
- **Data Visualization:** Generates interactive plots for log level distribution, hourly log counts, and organization-wise log analysis.
- **Thread and Organization Insights:** Summarizes log activity by thread and organization.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, SciPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Production Server:** Gunicorn
- **Frontend:** HTML (Jinja2 templates)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal (PowerShell recommended for Windows users) and run:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Smart_Log_Analyzer_for_Distributed_System.git
cd Smart_Log_Analyzer_for_Distributed_System
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip. Only the following packages are required for deployment and are listed in `requirements.txt`:
- Flask
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy
- gunicorn

Run:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application (Development)

Start the Flask development server:

```powershell
python app.py
```

The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

### 5. Deploying to Production (e.g., Render)
- Ensure you have a `Procfile` with the following content:
  ```
  web: gunicorn app:app
  ```
- Push your code to GitHub and connect your repository to Render.
- Render will use `requirements.txt` to install dependencies and the `Procfile` to start your app.

### 6. Using the Application
- Navigate to the home page.
- Upload your log file using the provided form.
- View statistical summaries, anomaly reports, and interactive visualizations generated from your log data.
